# Trackr

Find Lunch is a web page written using javascript, html, and css that accesses Yelp's Data using the Yelp Fusion API and renders elements based off of the users location and a variety of optional filters in order to find restaurants surrounding the user.

Find Lunch is intented to be used within a city and allows users to filter by distance in blocks. For the purposes of Find Lunch a "block" is defined using the distance of a New York city block which is 264 feet, however the length of blocks can vary from city to city.

Trackr is a web page written using Reactjs and css to style the JSX elements, that allows users to create lists of items and manage the inventory of items. The backend of Trackr is written using Ruby, Sinatra, and Postgresql.

Trackr is intended to be used by individuals or businesses that have a desire to keep track of their inventory of items.

We are working on a helper React Native app that allows users to scan an item and add it to one of their lists. The current iteration of this helper app can be found [https://snack.expo.dev/@buselax/joyous-croissant](here)
