# Trackr

Trackr is a web page written using Reactjs and css to style the JSX elements. Trackr allows users to create lists of items and manage the inventory of items. The backend of Trackr is written using Ruby, Sinatra, and Postgresql.

Trackr is intended to be used by individuals or businesses that have a desire to keep track of their inventory of items.

We are working on a helper React Native app that allows users to scan an item and add it to one of their lists. The current iteration of this helper app can be found [https://snack.expo.dev/@buselax/joyous-croissant](here)
